## Overview

> More accessible web, all over the world.

`acot` is an open-source Accessibility Testing Framework that uses headless Chrome ([puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)) to provide a means of testing any website or web app. It support for making the Web accessible with a flexible, highly reliable rule set that leverages browser-native APIs such as the AOM and DOM.

### Reliability

- By using the results rendered by the browser, a highly reliable audit is possible.
- `acot` provides original rules. In addition, it offers rules based on the proven [axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).

### Extensibility

- You can use the rules published in the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) Like plugin system.
- It's easy to implement and publish the rule sets you need for your team.
- The divided packages allow you to assemble a custom workflow that works best for your team.

### Portability

- You can create and publish your own configuration with Sharable Config.
- Provides Custom Runner for integration with Storybook.

```bash
